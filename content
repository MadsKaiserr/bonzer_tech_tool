When JavaScript takes too long to run, it may lead to a poor user experience, causing visitors to leave before the page fully loads. For this reason, JavaScript should be optimized, and unnecessary scripts reduced."

Downloading and parsing unused code wastes bandwidth and initial processing time, making the page unresponsive to user input. This directly harms interactivity metrics like Interaction to Next Paint (INP), leads to a poor user experience, and negatively affects Core Web Vitals scores, potentially impacting search rankings."

Optimizing main-thread work improves interactivity, user satisfaction, and search engine rankings, as responsiveness is a key factor in page performance metrics."

Optimizing LCP helps improve both user satisfaction and SEO."

This inefficiency directly harms key Core Web Vitals, such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and Interaction to Next Paint (INP), as the browser is tied up with non-critical assets. Since these metrics are crucial for search engine rankings, this can lead to lower visibility in search results."

This can negatively impact performance because browsers take longer to process and render large DOM trees. It can also lead to slower JavaScript execution, memory usage issues, and degraded user experience. Optimizing your DOM structure by removing unnecessary elements, flattening nested elements, and improving code cleanliness can enhance loading times and responsiveness."

When these resources prevent the browser from displaying the page immediately, it can lead to longer loading times and a poor user experience.

          "consequence": "Serving static assets like images (.webp, .png, .jpg) with short cache lifetime forces browsers to re-download these potentially large files often, even for returning users. This significantly increases page load times, consumes unnecessary bandwidth, and harms the user experience, especially on repeat visits. From an SEO perspective, this negatively impacts key performance metrics (including LCP) which are ranking factors, and signals inefficient resource management to search engines."
